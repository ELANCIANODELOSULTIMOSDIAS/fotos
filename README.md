Hello friends.
I intend to do a small project, which, little by little, will become bigger.
I do not want to do a great monumental work, I just want to do something useful for everyone, and free use and free distribution.

The technical characteristics are simple since I want to do HTML5 because the original idea or the original project I have it in a private Local Web on my PC, but I wanted to donate this to the public considering it useful because with the new technologies, we all take photos and It's a good idea to have a phone or tablet software to organize all this material, which can sometimes be quite bulky and in most cases we do not have control over the albums, that's why I want to do this little project (which will be progressively expanded ) in order to have organized all the photographic material that we have on the phone or - mainly - on the Tablet.

Everyone can collaborate, as well as correct my mistakes -which will surely be many errors- or also contribute new ideas to make this a useful and intuitive application for any user (there are people who are not very skilled with phones and this application can provide them the task of classifying your photographic material)

I am open to requests, to new ideas, to project implementations and modifications of any kind.

The project is oriented to be used in the Android Operating System and to be used mainly in Tablets since it is better to see the photos on a tablet because the screen is bigger than a phone.

Everyone can use this material, and I would like it, at least have the courtesy to comment on the origin of the idea and the URL so that other people interested in this project can contribute their own ideas, thus, together work together to do something that can be very useful, free and open source for others to make substantial improvements.

Thank you for your attention.
A greeting.

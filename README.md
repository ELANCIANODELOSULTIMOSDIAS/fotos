Hello friends.
I intend to do a small project, which, little by little, will become bigger.
I do not want to do a great monumental work, I just want to do something useful for everyone, and free use and free distribution.

Everyone can collaborate, as well as correct my mistakes or provide new ideas to make a very useful and intuitive application for any user.

I am open to requests, to new ideas, to project implementations and modifications of any kind.

The project is oriented to be used in the Android Operating System and to be used mainly in Tablets since it is better to see the photos on a tablet because the screen is bigger than a phone.

Everyone can use this material, and I would like it, at least have the courtesy to comment on the origin of the idea and the URL so that other people interested in this project can contribute their own ideas, thus, together work together to do something that can be very useful, free and open source for others to make substantial improvements.

Thank you for your attention.
A greeting.
